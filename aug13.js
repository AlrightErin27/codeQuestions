//-----------------------------ðŸ¥¸----LAST SURVIVOR----ðŸ¥¸-----------------------------//
// You are given a string of letters and an array of numbers.
// The numbers indicate positions of letters that must be removed, in order, starting from the beginning of the array.
// After each removal the size of the string decreases (there is no empty space).
// Return the only letter left.
// Example:

// let str = "zbk", arr = [0, 1]
//     str = "bk", arr = [1]
//     str = "b", arr = []
//     return 'b'
// Notes
// The given string will never be empty.
// The length of the array is always one less than the length of the string.
// All numbers are valid.
// There can be duplicate letters and numbers.

//-----------------------------ðŸ¥¸----SQUARE EVERY DIGIT----ðŸ¥¸-----------------------------//
// Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
// For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.
// Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

//-----------------------------ðŸ¥¸----PARTS OF A LIST----ðŸ¥¸-----------------------------//
// Write a function partlist that gives all the ways to divide a list (an array) of at least two elements
// into two non-empty parts.
// Each two non empty parts will be in a pair (or an array for languages without tuples or a structin C - C:
//     see Examples test Cases - )
// Each part will be in a string
// Elements of a pair must be in the same order as in the original array.

function partList(arr) {
  let newArr,
    result = [];
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    newArr = [];
    newArr.push(arr.slice(0, i).join(" "));
    newArr.push(arr.slice(i).join(" "));
    result.push(newArr);
  }
  return result;
}

//console.log(partList(["This", "is", "Sparta!"]));
//This, is Sparta
// This is, Sparta

//-----------------------------ðŸ¥¸----BOUNCING BALLS----ðŸ¥¸-----------------------------//
// A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.
// He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).
// His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.
// How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?

// Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:
// Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
// Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
// Float parameter "window" must be less than h.
// If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.

const bouncingBall = (h, b, w) =>
  h <= 0 || b <= 0 || b >= 1 || w >= h ? -1 : 2 + bouncingBall(h * b, b, w);

//console.log(bouncingBall(3, 0.66, 1.5)); //3

//-----------------------------ðŸ¥¸----VASYA CLERK----ðŸ¥¸-----------------------------//
// The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. E
// ach of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.
// Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.
// Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the
// order people queue?
// Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment.
// Otherwise return NO.
// Examples:
// tickets([25, 25, 50]) // => YES
// tickets([25, 100]) // => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars
// tickets([25, 25, 50, 50, 100]) // => NO.
